# Project-Hangman
## Simple text-based Hangman game developed in my first year as a programmer. 

To help improve the English vocabulary of individuals who did not have it as a first language, I developed this simple text game while I was waiting for to catch a flight. I developed this using using JAVA and JAVA's JFrame package. This application is capable of:
- Generating a random word for the user/player to guess the letters
- Providing users with the capabality to input a letter
