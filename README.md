# Project-Hangman
## Simple text-based Hangman game developed in my first year as a programmer. 

To help improve the English vocabulary of individuals who did not have it as a first language, I developed this simple text game while I was waiting for to catch a flight. I developed this using using JAVA and JAVA's JFrame package. Features of this application include:
- Generating a random word for the user/player to guess the letters
- Providing users with the capabality to input a letter
- Calculate a score for the user and update the game state (GameOver/New Game)
- Record scores in a Leaderboard
- Provide Users with hints for the word
- Save scores to leaderboard
And much more!
